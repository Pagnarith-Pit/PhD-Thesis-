Below is a **clear, academically rigorous explanation** of **why each analysis is important** for your research question and **how to interpret the results**. This can be inserted directly into your Methods or Discussion sections.

# **1. Descriptive Statistics**

### **Why This Is Important**

Descriptive statistics provide the foundational landscape of student AI use. Since your research aims to understand *how generative AI reshapes students’ learning practices*, it is crucial to first quantify:

* How frequently students use AI
* What purposes it is used for
* How students evaluate its usefulness
* How enabling vs. easing behaviours are distributed

This establishes the **baseline behaviour** of the student population and validates that the qualitative themes from Phase 1 appear in the broader sample.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **High frequency** of certain categories → indicates widespread, generalisable usage patterns.
* **Rare or low-frequency categories** → suggest that some qualitative findings represent niche behaviours.
* **Mean scores for SAMR categories**:

  * Higher “enabling” means → students are more likely to use AI in transformative ways.
  * Higher “easing” means → students primarily use AI to simplify or offload tasks.
* **Skewed distributions** may indicate polarised attitudes (e.g., some students use AI heavily; others avoid it).

This section answers:

> *How commonly do students integrate AI into their study practices?*

# **2. Prevalence of Each Usage Pattern**

### **Why This Is Important**

Your qualitative study identified specific usage patterns (e.g., conceptual explanation, summarisation, translation, debugging, assignment completion). The quantitative phase needs to determine:

* Which usage patterns are **common enough** to represent institutional trends
* Which patterns are **emerging behaviours** worth supporting
* Which patterns are **educationally concerning** (e.g., asking AI for answers)

This helps universities and AI tool designers prioritise interventions, support, or guardrails.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **High prevalence** → indicates stable, generalisable behaviours.
* **Moderate prevalence** → suggests context-dependent usage.
* **Low prevalence** → may mean the behaviour is rare, discipline-specific, or emerges only under special circumstances.

If a theme from Phase 1 shows up rarely in Phase 2, you may discuss this as:

> “A behaviour observed in qualitative data but not widely generalisable at scale.”

# **3. Frequency Distributions**

### **Why This Is Important**

AI usage behaviours may not be uniformly distributed. Frequency distributions allow you to observe patterns such as:

* Heavy-tailed usage (a minority use AI extensively)
* Bimodal distributions (groups of avoiders vs. enthusiasts)
* Normal or near-normal patterns (uniform adoption across the student population)

These insights are critical for designing targeted interventions and understanding heterogeneity within the student body.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Right-skewed** → many light users, few heavy users.
* **Left-skewed** → many heavy users, few light users.
* **Bimodal** → students are polarised; large groups either enthusiastically adopt or avoid AI.
* **Normal distribution** → indicates stable, homogeneous adoption patterns across the population.

This helps you argue whether AI adoption is **diffuse or polarised**.

# **4. Mean Scores for Enabling vs. Easing Behaviours**

### **Why This Is Important**

Your thesis focuses on the distinction between:

* **Enabling behaviours** = transformative learning practices
* **Easing behaviours** = efficiency or shortcut-based uses

Mean scores allow you to quantify *how much* AI is reshaping learning.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Higher enabling score** → AI is genuinely transforming learning (aligns with SAMR “Modification/Redefinition”).
* **Higher easing score** → AI is primarily used as a substitute or shortcut (aligns with SAMR “Substitution”).
* **Comparable scores** → mixed uses; AI supports both efficiency and transformation.

This connects directly to your main research question:

> *How is AI reshaping learning practices?*

# **5. Inferential Tests**

## A. Group Comparisons (ANOVA, t-tests)

### **Why This Is Important**

You need to examine whether particular student groups differ in their AI usage:

* STEM vs. non-STEM
* Undergraduates vs. postgraduates
* Domestic vs. international students
* High-AI-proficiency vs. low-proficiency users

This helps identify **who benefits most** and where targeted support may be necessary.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Significant differences** → group membership meaningfully shapes AI use or AI-derived outcomes.
* **Non-significant differences** → behaviours are consistent across demographic or academic groups, suggesting broader generalisability.

Examples:

* If STEM students use enabling AI tools more → this supports the idea that procedural/technical domains benefit differently.
* If international students rely more on translation → this has implications for inclusivity and language support.

## B. Correlations

### **Why This Is Important**

Your conceptual model assumes that factors like AI proficiency, usage style, and perceived outcomes are related. Correlations show:

* Whether relationships exist
* Whether these relationships are positive or negative
* How strong they are

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Strong positive correlation** (e.g., enabling use ↗ and perceived learning gain ↗) → enabling AI behaviours are pedagogically beneficial.
* **Strong negative correlation** (e.g., easing use ↗ and engagement ↘) → surface-level use may be detrimental.
* **Weak correlation** → behaviours are independent or context-specific.

Correlations support your theorisation of *how AI use reshapes learning*.

## C. Regression Models

### **Why This Is Important**

Regression allows you to *predict* learning outcomes from:

* AI usage types
* AI proficiency
* Demographic variables
* Course discipline

This helps establish the *relative importance* of your predictors.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Significant coefficients** → these factors meaningfully predict learning outcomes.
* **Large effect sizes** → strong practical significance.
* **Non-significant predictors** → the variable may not matter in real-world educational contexts.

This shapes your final argument about what AI tools actually do for learning.

# **6. Structural and Exploratory Analyses**

## A. Factor Analysis

### **Why This Is Important**

Factor analysis tests whether the themes from Phase 1:

* Are statistically real
* Cluster together in coherent dimensions
* Represent valid, measurable constructs

This strengthens the legitimacy of your qualitative findings.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Loadings > 0.40** → strong association with the factor
* **Clear factor structure** → Phase 1 themes are valid
* **Cross-loadings** → behaviours may overlap
* **Poor structure** → themes may require reconceptualisation

This helps bridge qualitative and quantitative insights.

---

## B. Cluster Analysis

### **Why This Is Important**

Cluster analysis identifies *types of AI users* within your population. Examples:

* Transformative Users
* Efficiency Seekers
* Answer Dependents
* Minimal Users

These archetypes help universities design targeted policy, training, and tool support.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Distinct clusters** → students differ meaningfully in their AI behaviour.
* **Cluster sizes** → show how common each archetype is.
* **Cluster characteristics** → indicate learning mindsets, motivations, and risks.

This gives real-world actionable insights for educators.

---

## C. Path Models (SEM or mediation models)

### **Why This Is Important**

Path modelling allows you to test *causal pathways* implied by your theory:

* Does AI proficiency lead to more enabling use?
* Does usage type mediate learning outcomes?
* Does discipline influence outcomes through usage patterns?

This produces a theoretically grounded explanation of student behaviour.

### **How to Interpret the Results**

* **Significant mediated pathways** → support your claim that usage style drives outcomes.
* **Non-significant paths** → challenge assumptions about how AI influences learning.
* **Good model fit indices** (CFI > 0.90, RMSEA < 0.08) → the theoretical model aligns well with the empirical data.

This ties your entire thesis together by showing *how AI reshapes learning in a structured, causal manner*.
